# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

1. Select Your Operating System (OS)
To start, I chose to install Windows 11. I visited the Windows 11 download page, downloaded the Installation Assistant, and followed the instructions to complete the installation on my computer. The process was straightforward, and I didn't encounter any issues.

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
For my IDE, I selected Visual Studio Code due to its popularity and extensive features. I went to the Visual Studio Code download page, downloaded the installer, and followed the on-screen instructions to set it up. The installation was quick and easy.

3. Set Up Version Control System
Setting up Git was my next step. I downloaded Git from the Git download page, ran the installer, and followed the setup instructions. After installation, I opened a terminal and configured Git with my username and email using git config --global user.name "My Name" and git config --global user.email "my.email@example.com". I also created a GitHub account at GitHub. In my project directory, I initialized a Git repository with git init, created a README file, added it with git add README.md, and made my first commit using git commit -m "Initial commit". Finally, I created a new repository on GitHub, linked it to my local repository, and pushed my changes.

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes
For this project, I needed Python. I downloaded it from the Python download page, ran the installer, and ensured the "Add Python to PATH" option was checked. To confirm the installation, I opened a terminal and typed python --version.

5. Install Package Managers
Pip, the package manager for Python, comes installed by default. I verified its installation by typing pip --version in the terminal.

6. Configure a Database
I installed MySQL by visiting the MySQL download page, downloading the installer, and following the setup instructions. During the installation, I set a root password and configured MySQL. I confirmed the installation by connecting to the MySQL server using mysql -u root -p in the terminal.

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional)
Although optional, I decided to set up Docker to explore virtualization. I downloaded Docker Desktop from the Docker download page, ran the installer, and followed the setup instructions. I verified the installation by typing docker --version in the terminal.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins
To enhance Visual Studio Code, I explored and installed several extensions. I opened Visual Studio Code, went to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), and installed extensions like Python for development, GitLens for Git integration, and Prettier for code formatting.

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
